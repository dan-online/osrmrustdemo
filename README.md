# OSRM Rust Demo

This is a demo of the bindings libraries for the [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) routing engine. There are 3 main libraries that are used:

- [osrm-rs](osrm-rs) - A deliveroo project
- [rs_osrm](https://github.com/TehGoat/rs_osrm) - The only of the three actually published as a crate
- [rsc_osrm](rsc_osrm) - Another crate but not published

## Usage

This demo runs a benchmark of the 3 libraries using a certain amount of random coordinates within a certain radius of a point. It then outputs a chart with the results for comparison.

The other purpose of this demo is the Dockerfile which provides the perfect environment for running these libraries.

### Running with Docker

#### Building the image

```bash
$ docker build -t osrm-rust-demo .
$ docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app osrm-rust-demo /bin/bash
```

#### Running the demo

##### CLI

```bash
